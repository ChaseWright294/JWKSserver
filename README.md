GitHub CoPilot was used throughout the project to assist with debugging and methodology of server connections. Prompts generally followed the pattern of "I am getting an error with line xx in this file, and need steps to solve it". Additionally, it was used for most of the test writing, since configuring jest was an issue for me. I asked for simple tests for the 4 files the server uses to run.
